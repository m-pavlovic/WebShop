# WebShop Implementation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### Dynamic Content Panel System âœ…
- **MainFrame** now manages 4 main content panels:
  - `HomePanel` - Welcome/dashboard view
  - `CartPanel` - Shopping cart view
  - `ProfilePanel` - User profile management
  - `ContactPanel` - Contact information and support

### Panel Switching Implementation âœ…
- Added `showPanel(JPanel panel)` method for generic panel switching
- Added specific methods: `showHomePanel()`, `showCartPanel()`, `showProfilePanel()`, `showContactPanel()`
- Default panel set to HomePanel on application startup

### Event-Driven Navigation âœ…
- **MainController** handles toolbar events and calls appropriate panel switching methods:
  - HOME button â†’ `showHomePanel()`
  - CART button â†’ `showCartPanel()`
  - PROFILE button â†’ `showProfilePanel()`
  - CONTACT button â†’ `showContactPanel()`

### Panel Architecture âœ…
- All panels are proper `JPanel` subclasses in the `view` package
- Each panel has placeholder content that can be further developed
- Panels follow MVC pattern and can be extended with their own controllers

## Current Application Features

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **Java 21 Upgrade** - Running on latest LTS
2. **MVC Architecture** - Proper separation of concerns
3. **Event-driven UI** - ToolBarEvent system
4. **Authentication System** - Login and registration
5. **Dynamic Navigation** - Content panel switching
6. **Professional UI** - Centered toolbar buttons with dark blue borders

### ðŸ”„ Ready for Extension
- Panel content can be enhanced with specific functionality
- Additional event types can be added
- Database integration can be implemented
- More sophisticated authentication features

## Technical Implementation

### Key Classes
- `MainFrame` - Main window with content panel management
- `ToolBarPanel` - Navigation toolbar with event generation
- `MainController` - Coordinates UI interactions
- `HomePanel`, `CartPanel`, `ProfilePanel`, `ContactPanel` - Content views

### Event Flow
1. User clicks toolbar button
2. `ToolBarPanel` generates `ToolBarEvent`
3. `MainController` receives event via listener
4. `MainController` calls appropriate `MainFrame.show*Panel()` method
5. `MainFrame` switches displayed content panel

## Build and Run
```bash
# Compile
.\apache-maven-3.9.6\bin\mvn.cmd clean compile

# Run
.\apache-maven-3.9.6\bin\mvn.cmd exec:java
```

The application successfully compiles and runs with all 18 source files, demonstrating a robust, event-driven MVC architecture ready for further development.
